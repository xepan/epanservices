<h1>Requirement <small>(installation)</small></h1>
<p>
	We strongly recommand Linux system, but XEC has been tested on windows and Macs also. The requirement for XEC
	As of current version is a bit strict. This needs <b>PHP 7.0 ~ 7.1 (not 7.2)</b> and <b>Mariadb 10.1</b>.
	<br/>
	XEC is tested on apache 2.4 as well as stable nginx. Apache 2.4 uses .htaccess file while nginx rules can
	be converted for same or call us for help in setup ;) .
